Instructions

Draw the bezier curve control points on the leftmost half of the screen.
Use the [left mouse] button to place points, [right mouse] button to
move points and [shift]+[right mouse] button to remove points. The 
complexity of the final curve can the increased and decreased by 
pressing the [a] and [s] keys. The revolution solid corresponding to
the generated curve will be automatically generated on the rightmost
portion of the screen. You can control the number of "revolution steps"
with the [,] and [.] keys And the revolution axis with the [x],[y] and
[z] keys. All these parameters are displayed on the status bar of the
application window.


[1],[2],[3] change the camera to orthogonal views from the X, Y and Z 
axis respectivelly and [4] changes the camera to a perspective view
from world coordinates (3,3,3). The [=] and [-] keys zoom the 3D 
visualization in and out respectivelly the [0] key resets the zoom.

[q],[w],[e] change the visualization mode of the solid to points, tris
and filled polygons respectivelly, while [u],[i] and [p] change the 
texture and lighting parameters to simulate a highly specular (metal),
almost completely diffuse (fabric) and slightly specular surface
respectivelly.

By left-clicking  and dragging on the rightmost half of the screen,
you can rotate the  "camera" around the center of the universe.

Shift+[c] resets everything.
